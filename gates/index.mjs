/**
 * The registry.
 *
 * `needs` declares what a gate wants, so the runner can gather it once instead of
 * every gate reaching for the filesystem itself:
 *
 *   source        every tracked source file, with lines pre-split
 *   markdown      every tracked markdown file
 *   repoFiles     the full path list, for existence checks
 *   addedSql      .sql files added relative to the base branch
 *
 * `skipWhen` returns a REASON STRING when the gate cannot or need not run, and a
 * falsy value otherwise. The runner prints that reason and marks the gate
 * skipped rather than passed. Returning a reason instead of a boolean is what
 * makes the difference between the two skips below visible, and that distinction
 * is the whole safety property:
 *
 *   "no new migrations in this change"      we looked, there was nothing to check
 *   "cannot see history"                    we could not look at all
 *
 * The second one used to render as the first. A shallow CI clone has no base ref,
 * so no migrations appear added, so the gate reported the reassuring message and
 * everybody assumed migrations were being checked. They were not, for as long as
 * nobody looked. Adding a gate is easy; the hard part is making sure a green run
 * means what people think it means.
 *
 * Adding a gate means adding an entry here and nothing else.
