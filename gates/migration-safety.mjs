/**
 * The window where the old code runs against the new schema.
 *
 * Almost every deploy pipeline migrates before it swaps the application:
 *
 *     migrate  ->  build  ->  restart
 *
 * Between step one and step three, the PREVIOUS version of your app is talking to
 * the NEW database. On a good day that window is ninety seconds. If the build
 * fails, that window is however long it takes someone to notice, which at 3am is
 * measured in hours.
 *
 * So a migration is not "does the new code work with this schema". It is "does
 * the OLD code survive this schema". The statements below break that, always.
 *
 * The fix is always the same shape, and it is called expand-contract: add the new
 * thing, deploy code that writes both, backfill, deploy code that reads the new
 * one, and only then, in a LATER release, remove the old thing. It is two deploys
 * where you wanted one. That is the price.
 *
 * Only NEW migrations are checked. History is already applied everywhere and is
 * none of this gate's business, so the caller passes in the added files.
 *
 * WHY THIS PARSES STATEMENTS RATHER THAN LINES. The first version matched line by
 * line, and quietly missed the very thing it existed for:
 *
 *     ALTER TABLE orders
 *       ADD COLUMN currency VARCHAR(3)
 *       NOT NULL;
 *
 * `ADD COLUMN` and `NOT NULL` are on different lines, so no single line matched
 * and the migration passed. Prisma emits single-line DDL, which is why it looked
 * fine in testing; hand-written migrations wrap constantly. Statements are split
 * on semicolons outside string literals, and each finding reports the line the
 * statement started on.
