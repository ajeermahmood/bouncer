/**
 * Grandfathering, so a gate can be switched on in a codebase that already
 * violates it.
 *
 * This is the feature that decides whether a tool like this is adoptable at all.
 * Turning on a new gate in a mature repository surfaces two hundred existing
 * findings. Nobody is going to fix two hundred things before merging anything
 * else, so without a baseline the realistic options are to not add the gate, or
 * to add it as a warning that everybody learns to scroll past. Both mean the rule
 * is not enforced.
 *
 * A baseline records what was already wrong on the day the gate was switched on.
 * Those findings stop blocking. Anything NEW blocks immediately. The debt stays
 * visible and countable, and the bleeding stops the same afternoon.
 *
 * THE FINGERPRINT IS NOT THE LINE NUMBER. That is the mistake this design exists
 * to avoid. A baseline keyed on line numbers is invalidated the first time
 * somebody adds an import at the top of a file, and then two hundred
 * grandfathered findings reappear at once, in a pull request that had nothing to
 * do with any of them. People stop trusting the tool that same day.
 *
 * Keyed instead on rule, path, and the normalised text of the offending line, a
 * finding survives moving up and down the file, and stops being suppressed the
 * moment somebody edits that line, which is exactly when it deserves a fresh
 * look.
