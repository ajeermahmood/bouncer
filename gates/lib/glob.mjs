/**
 * The glob dialect used by `exclude` in bouncer.config.json.
 *
 * Deliberately tiny and deliberately single-pass: a double star spans
 * directories, a single star stops at a slash, everything else is literal. No
 * dependency, and no ambiguity about which flavour of glob this is.
 *
 * Written as a character walk rather than a chain of replaces because that chain
 * has an ordering hazard: expanding the single star first corrupts any double
 * star not yet handled, and the usual fix is placeholder tokens that then have to
 * be impossible to collide with. An earlier version used NUL bytes as those
 * tokens, which worked and quietly made the runner read as a binary file to grep
 * and to Bouncer's own file reader. One pass has no ordering to get wrong and no
 * tokens to choose badly.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in the runner because the runner executes the whole
 * CLI at import time, so anything exported from it is untestable in practice.
