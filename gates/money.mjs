/**
 * Two bugs hiding in one innocent-looking expression.
 *
 *     Math.round(parseFloat(input) * 100)
 *
 * This is how most codebases turn "12.34" into minor units. It is wrong twice.
 *
 * 1. BINARY FLOATS. 10.005 is not representable, so it is stored slightly below
 *    10.005, and Math.round gives 1000 rather than 1001. The customer is charged
 *    a cent less, the ledger disagrees with the payment provider, and it happens
 *    rarely enough that nobody reproduces it for months.
 *
 * 2. THE HARDCODED 100. It assumes every currency has two decimal places.
 *    Japanese yen has zero, so a JPY amount comes out 100x too large. Bahraini
 *    dinar has three, so it comes out 10x too small. The first time this matters
 *    is the day you sell to a new country, which is also the day nobody is
 *    looking for a currency bug.
 *
 * The fix is not "round more carefully". It is to stop letting float touch money
 * at all: parse the decimal string to an integer directly, and get the exponent
 * from the currency.
