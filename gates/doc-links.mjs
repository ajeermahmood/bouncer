/**
 * Every relative link in the docs points at a file that exists.
 *
 * This is the cheapest gate here and it earns its place for a reason that only
 * became obvious once agents started reading the repo.
 *
 * A stale doc link used to cost a human thirty seconds: they notice the 404,
 * shrug, and grep for the file. An agent does not shrug. It follows the link,
 * finds nothing, and then either invents what the document probably said or
 * spends a long time hunting. Both outcomes are worse than the broken link, and
 * neither is visible in the diff it eventually produces.
 *
 * So: docs that lie are a correctness problem now, not a tidiness one.
 *
 * A note on how this is scoped, because the first version was quietly broken.
 * It listed files with `git ls-files "*.md" "**\/*.md"`. On Linux the shell
 * expanded those patterns before git ever saw them, and `**` is not recursive in
 * sh, so only top-level markdown was checked while the gate cheerfully reported
 * OK. On Windows the patterns reached git intact and it worked. A gate that
 * passes for the wrong reason is worse than no gate. This version takes the file
 * list as an argument and filters in JavaScript, which behaves the same
 * everywhere.
