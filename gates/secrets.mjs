/**
 * Two problems, one gate.
 *
 * 1. SECRETS. A credential or private key committed to the repo. Obvious harm,
 *    well-trodden ground.
 *
 * 2. DANGEROUS SHAPE. Code that merely READS like offensive tooling: a remote
 *    script piped into a shell, TLS verification switched off, host-key checking
 *    auto-accepted, a payload decoded into a root path.
 *
 * The second one is the unusual half, and it is here for a reason that is not
 * primarily about security.
 *
 * A repository that deploys to a VPS legitimately needs some of these shapes.
 * What happened in practice is that AI coding agents working in that repo were
 * repeatedly refused, or escalated to a human, on files that were completely
 * benign, because the surrounding code pattern-matched to an attack. Sessions
 * died halfway. Nobody could tell which refusals were real.
 *
 * Keeping the shape clean fixed it. So this is a working-conditions gate as much
 * as a security one: the team stopped fighting their own tools.
