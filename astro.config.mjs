/**
 * Static output, deployed to Cloudflare Workers.
 *
 * The playground needs a server, but not a rendered one: it posts a snippet to
 * `/api/scan`. On Workers that route is handled by `worker/index.js`, which
 * serves everything else from the assets binding; on Pages the equivalent is
 * `functions/api/scan.js`, picked up by convention. Either way the pages stay
 * static and exactly one endpoint runs code.
 *
 * That endpoint imports the same files `bin/bouncer.mjs` imports. There is no
 * browser reimplementation of the rules to drift out of sync with the real ones,
 * which was the main risk in putting a demo on the site at all.
