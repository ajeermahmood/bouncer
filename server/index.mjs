/**
 * The same gates, as a plain Node service. Deployed on Railway.
 *
 * This exists to make one point precisely. `functions/api/scan.js` is a
 * Cloudflare Worker, `bin/bouncer.mjs` is a CLI, `Playground.tsx` runs them in a
 * browser tab, and this is a long-lived Node process. Four runtimes, four
 * deployment models, and not one line of duplicated rule logic between them.
 *
 * That is the entire return on making gates pure functions. It is not an
 * aesthetic preference about side effects; it is the reason a rule can be
 * written once and then enforced in CI, in an editor, in a pre-commit hook, in a
 * hosted API for a team that does not run Node, and on a marketing site.
